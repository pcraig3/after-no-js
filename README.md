# After using React Context and optional JS

## Setup

- clone repo
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`
- visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## Idea behind the example

### App-wide data store

Store global data using [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
Means we can update themes and languages and whatever.

### No-JS (in progress)

Use encrypted cookies to store values that we can access on the server or the client.
under construction but it's going well.

- âœ… save a value globally
- âœ… works with or without JS
- âœ… save form values in a fairly generic way between pages
- âœ… don't hardcode the theme into the store
- âš’ form validation with or without JS
