# After using React Context and optional JS

## Setup

- clone repo
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`
- visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- 🚀

## Idea behind the example

- Caching

Store global data using [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
Means we can update themes and languages and whatever.

- No-JS (TODO)

Should work with or without JS. Stay tuned. 👷‍
